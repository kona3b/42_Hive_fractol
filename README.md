A project for Hive. 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals, using minilibX.
Generating fractals.

Run make and launch with ./fractol <fractal name> (mandelbrot, julia or tricorn). (ignore warnings from outdated mlx library)

Due to limited time available for this project (3 days), what I returned was the MVP version.

There is also an improved version in the works.
